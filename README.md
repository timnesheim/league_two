## Analyzing League Two

# Description
The EFL League Two competition in England that isn't as famous as the Premier League but can be just as important. Finishing in the bottom two places of the league leads to be relegated out of the EFL, which can make or break a club. With inspiration from this [article][https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-soccer-league-tables-is-historical-data-the-way-to-go-840e4272f1c4], I wanted to see if there's a way to predict what teams were promoted and what teams were relegated

# Data
